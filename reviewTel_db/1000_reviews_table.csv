77,2,09/01/2015,13, floor tiles in bath room shower were slippery when wet Black coating on glass wall between bath bed room was obviously an attempt to darken the glass tint that was inadequate Hall way to rooms on 2nd floor was too dark gloomy Reception area stuffy too hot on day we checked in I question the 4 star rating, staff good location suited us,7.1, Leisure trip,2,4,1

83,2,4/19/2017,36, Staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective Every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say I don t know the answer let me find out for you There didn t seem to be a manager around Unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished The temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad Breakfast was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet , Location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good ,6.3, Leisure trip,2,3,3
84,2,7/27/2016,36, The front desk staff particularly the young men tended to be a bit spaced out and were not very helpful at times however the female attendants on the desk were quite efficient and knowledgeable Breakfast was a bit pricey especially for two people combined , The rooms were comfortable and clean and the bed accommodated sleep well Restaurant and bar staff were very helpful and friendly The breakfast was quite good where there was a variety of selections available to choose from ,7.1, Business trip,2,1,5

86,2,12/22/2015,40, the restaurant food was terrible my first room was facing the garden construction site which starts at 6am in the morning although per local law is not allowed when I reach the staff he said he could do nothing about it while the construction is actually owned by the hotel it s a real bazaar they can t control it after my insisting they changed my room but the fridge safe and sink wasn t working I stayed there 14 days never again , nothing,3.1, Business trip,1,4,14

89,2,10/11/2016,67, So lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying One person in our group got 220v electric chock which went through her hands It came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler Luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately The hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room They also let us have a late check out for free of charge Thats all of the compensation we had In my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think The managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it The hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too It anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel Ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened Some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave Picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms, Anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there Location of the hotel is about 1km from the nearest metro station The rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in However there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion ,4.2, Leisure trip,4,3,2
90,2,5/22/2017,68, Careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you , Great hotel original concept style,8.3, Business trip,1,3,2

94,2,4/18/2017,74, Several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around Also the standard rooms are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows This is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the room being somewhat stuffy , The hotel is nicely localted directly within the park which is accessed when walking out of the building The building itself has great history and wonderful architecture The staff is very helpful and friendly when in need of anything ,7.5, Leisure trip,2,4,3
95,2,12/19/2016,74, The breakfast was rather average from quality and appearance and not that well organized The young gentlemen managing this were more interested in watching the young female guests This was nice to see but at the same time spoons butter coffee etc were out I would expect a better experience for that price , The building was fantastic All renovated areas were very stylish The receptionist was very friendly and gave us a warm start in this place ,6.7, Leisure trip,2,3,2
96,2,03/02/2016,74, I hate when the beds are two separate beds pushed together That may just be a European thing or maybe I got the reservation wrong either way I would still go back to this hotel, The place looked amazing and it was close enough to everything that walking was not a hassle,8.8, Leisure trip,2,4,2

101,2,08/03/2017,93,No Negative, No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam ,7.5, Leisure trip,2,4,4
102,2,6/30/2017,93, We did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this The room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment , We loved the location of this hotel The fact that it is set in a Park away from the busy centre of dam square was great The tram system was brilliant and easy to handle The hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy Staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from Ireland ,7.5, Leisure trip,2,4,3
103,2,4/26/2017,93, not cleaned well lady pushing to pay during my breakfast poor signs for temporary reception during renovation, the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park,7.1, Business trip,4,4,1
104,2,9/19/2016,93, split level bedrooms although quirky are impractical 1 TV remote for both tv s but on differernt floors A C is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust The walls are also very thin not good sound proofing , beautiful surroundings great location Old world style of the hotel is really different,6.3, Business trip,1,4,2
105,2,04/05/2016,93, The hotel is currently under going renovations and while this wasnt a major problem work did start early on Mon morning , Staff were very friendly helpful The kitchen provided us a great meal the bar staff were nice and the breakfast bar was very impressive ,7.9, Leisure trip,2,4,3
106,2,12/31/2015,93, The hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside During working hours the noise can be very disturbing The facilities look and sound rickety The A C is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold What s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls Chinese water torture anyone The bathroom walls are transparent And I don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint I mean Oh my word I didn t want to see that There is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom The staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them 3 days in a row with no new towels The hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it If you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead Or another hotel , Polite staff ,4.2, Leisure trip,2,4,3
107,2,11/24/2015,93, The toilet has glass walls no privacy The room was dirty after 3 days because the cleaners never hoovered the room the towels never changed the fridge was empty the room was very small I don t understand how this hotel has 4 stars The day of our check out we were forced to leave the hotel at 8 30 because they would cut the electricity and the hot water due to renovation in the hotel , The hall,4.6, Leisure trip,2,4,3

113,2,12/15/2015,95, In our own experience First night we couldn t sleep due to an extreme hot problem caused by the AC The next day we were moved to a better room ok but I was expecting to be refund for the night without proper sleep and we didn t AC was very noisy also in the new room And last At reception you will be told that reserving a taxi to the airport will cost 44Euro After doing so the taxi driver eventually charged us 55 Euro The driver simply said not responsible for promises from the hotel reception Be aware of that if you wanna use taxi from Arena, Staff was vey pleasant The place is very well designed,5.8, Leisure trip,2,4,3
114,2,10/30/2015,95, At first glance it looks like a dream hotel But then when you go see the hotel renovated and under construction which was not mentioned to us in advance Importantly they did not hear the construction work but ideally they indicate the presence of this order Even the room itself looked like dreams a room with two floors first floor shower toilet living room and a small refrigerator upstairs bedroom But at night when you go to sleep it becomes a nightmare room The doors of the rooms slammed shut and all entry and exit from different sound intensity in our room There really bad in this hotel because of the noise of slamming doors In addition the room may flooring and also hear every footstep in the room above you and from you Clean room we had not exchanged towels for 3 days until we asked , The best thing at this price excellent price in relation to the modern and spacious room received ,6.7, Leisure trip,2,4,5

119,2,02/06/2017,121, The place is completely mismanaged The property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice Don t stay here if you are expecting a 4 star experience it s a 4 star location with 1 star service The restaurant service is the worst I have ever experienced The staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently The hotel has many strange design choices too Had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet Shower overflows all over bathroom quickly You can see into the urinals from the reception area Loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly Put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs This is the only negative review I have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management , The property is beautiful,4.6, Leisure trip,4,3,7

123,2,6/29/2016,137, We would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated We had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at 6 30 because of the noise Booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel , Very friendly staff lovely comfy room,7.1, Leisure trip,2,3,1
124,2,05/03/2016,137, There was a staircase in our room between the bed and the bathroom This means the bathroom is very spacious and lovely but can be a bit of a pain in the middle of the night , The hotel has its own character and a long history Very cool vibe We got a round of free drinks as consolation to the construction work outside ,8.3, Leisure trip,2,4,6

130,2,05/03/2016,142, It would have been nice if the one responsible for the cleaning of the room had swept up the crumbs from the floor It was noisy from the main street It was not heated floor in the bathroom and as it rained pretty much during our stay it was difficult with wet shoes There was construction site all around the hotel and the choice would have fell on another hotel if we had known this I am sure it will be very nice when it is finished , Good breakfast nice beds nice to live at a hotel with history ,7.1, Leisure trip,2,4,4

138,2,08/03/2017,157, I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer , Only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful ,2.9, Leisure trip,2,4,6
139,2,4/20/2017,157, The glass wall separating the bathroom and the toilet from the room is a weird solution for double It is necessary to darken the glasses much more , Very nice hotel located in a park Ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center Not typical for Amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings But pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed ,8.8, Leisure trip,2,4,2
140,2,11/15/2016,158, The hotel is being renovated Which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at 7am We paid EUR350 for a large room but really it was not worth the money , The location is beautiful I m sure after the renovations this will be a lovely hotel ,5.4, Leisure trip,2,2,1
141,2,1/25/2017,174, Very bad attitude of personnel at Breakfast Only allowed one coffee from the Coffee machine filter coffee was free Rude behavior of the manager Room was noisy because of dripping water sound heater system in room , Location is good They gave me some freebies for noisy room,6.3, Leisure trip,2,4,1

143,2,7/14/2016,174, there is a renovation ongoing in front of the hotel which will hopefully be completed soon as it kills the view, Vibe is good location good and historic building is will be beautiful,7.9, Leisure trip,1,3,1

148,2,10/13/2016,184, The room was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon Having a shower steamed up the room and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere , It s a beautiful hotel or should I say will be when the renovation is finished ,7.1, Business trip,4,3,2
149,2,4/19/2016,184, The interiors are looking quite tired and the deluxe room on two levels was not to our liking This hotel was listed as four star though we would not consider this an accurate rating , Quiet location and thankfully the construction to the exterior of the hotel did not impact our stay ,5.4, Leisure trip,2,4,2

155,2,7/31/2017,200, My room was dirty and I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in bed and ready to sleep , Great location in nice surroundings the bar and restaurant are nice and have a lovely outdoor area The building also has quite some character ,3.8, Leisure trip,1,4,3
156,2,5/25/2017,200, Nothing at all to do with the Hotel of course but people tend to Slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a Slam to awake you Other than that nothing to fault at all , The Hotel itself is in a lovely location a 5min if that tram ride into the center Train right outside the Hotel easy access to everywhere The Staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice Wonderful bright comfortable and clean rooms Beds are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds Bathroom was clean spacious and airy We had Shampoo Body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair room service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees It literally has everything you need in the room Perfect Hotel couldn t fault it at all The lovely smell from the restaurant downstairs is great Tennis court outside the Hotel little pond as well and a huge park to walk around ,9.6, Leisure trip,4,4,2
158,2,4/20/2017,200, the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights But apart from that there is not really much I dislike about the Hotel I suppose if there is one thing the room I had did not have a view only other rooms but I dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal I can find that I did not like plus stayed for 2 nights and this place was perfect for that, The location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam,8.8, Leisure trip,2,4,2
159,2,3/22/2017,200,No Negative, The quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise The location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants I cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone ,10, Leisure trip,2,4,2
160,2,3/20/2017,200, The bar was shut when I got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a Saturday night in a city like Amsterdam , My room was upgraded because they are doing renovations in part of the building The room I was given was enormous and very comfortable I wish I had been staying for a week not just one night ,9.6, Leisure trip,1,4,1
161,2,2/20/2017,200,No Negative, The hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing They even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when I emailed them about this when I first booked online This was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town It is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too I would highly recommend ,10, Leisure trip,2,4,3
162,2,2/17/2017,200, there was construction work going on in the hotel which i was not expecting and would like to have known about in advance the bar staff we not keen to serve use when we arrived late from the airport at 11 30pm despite at check in being told the bar was open until 12 mid night , location in the park Cool interior design comfy bed ,7.1, Business trip,1,4,1
163,2,1/27/2017,200, Soundproofing was poor could hear everything from outside our room and woke one morning thinking someone had come into our room as sound was so clear Service and food in the restaurant was awful at dinner so we didn t eat there again , I d booked the trip as a surprise for my partners birthday We got a free room upgrade upon arrival and balloons delivery to the room by the front of house staff to wish him a happy birthday Great staff very welcoming friendly and helpful Lovely room very comfy bed ,8.3, Leisure trip,2,4,3
164,2,12/14/2016,200, upgraded on arrival very good but unfortunately lovely room had a smell of cigarettes mixed with perfume so changed room next room in attic annexe very cold offered a heater but asked to change again back to regular sized room perfectly adequate as on my own and comfortable but bothered by traffic noise from main road outside , breakfast on first day bacon ran out new batch was undercooked and not very hot limited choice of cereal and bread next day much improved more cereal yogurt and cooked tomatoes added ,6.3, Leisure trip,1,4,2
165,2,12/12/2016,200, The hotel is undergoing massive construction with workers all around and this was not indicated at the time of booking We had a rodent in the room one night due to the disturbance of construction , The location on the park is excellent and very peaceful The restaurant cafe in the lobby is a wonderful environment and they make excellent coffee ,7.1, Leisure trip,2,3,3
166,2,12/10/2016,200,No Negative, Hotel was really nice staff were very friendly and helpful I requested a split level room which they gave me when I arrived The room it self was extremely nice and clean and the bed was very comfy The hotel is not in the centre however is a walkable distance or easily got to by the Metro Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning ,9.2, Leisure trip,2,4,2
167,2,10/12/2016,200, In a terrible state with builders everywhere We had to wait to get into our room as the conference event builders were blocking the door Our room that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair , Good location Cheap ,5, Business trip,2,4,1
168,2,07/05/2016,200,No Negative, Architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels The Arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space Location is fab in the green space of Oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the City Halls The rooms are quirky with a small footprint THe ground level has a closet small sofa WC and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level There s a tv on each level ,10, Leisure trip,2,4,2

170,2,5/28/2016,200, Our suite on the 3 floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle The staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller rooms were offered For the price you would have expected at least a comfortable bed, this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority It is starting to look frayed at the edges But there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good The location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam ,7.5, Leisure trip,2,1,3
171,2,5/22/2016,200, Overpriced breakfast Bed too soft Bath had no shelf to leave bottles etc on Building works impact on overall good impression , Special ambience of old convent and medical institution converted into a modern style hotel Relaxed atmosphere Nice restaurant and bar area with terasse Good accessibility of public transport ,7.5, Leisure trip,2,4,3

177,2,3/29/2016,200, When we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin room which is not what we had asked for Once we came back down and asked to be switched rooms we got a far nicer room probably twice the size with a kingsize bed so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple Also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with breakfast or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste , The bed was super cosy The staff was nice The hotel isn t central but if you get bikes it s very close and easy to cycle ,8.8, Leisure trip,2,4,3
178,2,2/16/2016,200, Location is a little far from centre the hotel is tired it needs a bit of money spending on it polish it up and make feel new again as it doesn t feel new it feels tired , Cool hotel nice feel really comfy beds staff couldn t do enough for you,7.9, Leisure trip,4,4,3

180,2,02/09/2016,200, The shower was slightly faulty but we told the staff and they will be giving us some money back The room could ve been slightly cleaner in places and the refurbishments going on meant that the hotel was surrounded by construction works But very good value for money , The bed and size space in room was amazing very comfortable stay Very happy with our room for the money that we paid ,7.1, Leisure trip,2,4,2
181,2,02/02/2016,200, the change over of staff at the check in too many different faces over 3 days must of been greeted and welcomed by 8 different members of staff just at the reception desk that the rooms were not depicted on the site as they were when we arrived the room was stunning but would of liked to have seen that when booking, The decor the atmosphere the welcoming staff the room was incredible,9.6, Leisure trip,2,4,3

183,2,01/02/2016,200, The fact that building work meant the nightclub and half hotel were closed Woken by builders two mornings at 7am complained to reception who said it was saturday the next day so shouldnt get woken up no other compensation offered apart from a drink token on arrival in the form of two halves of heineken not good enough in our opinion , The room we upgraded to was very nice ,6.7, Leisure trip,2,4,3

185,2,12/26/2015,200, The bathrooms are more like a cubical with transparent glass Not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy Considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the bar I thought this was a nice gesture until I was repeatedly told I can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or 25cl beer You might have well not bothered Hotel Arena It was more like an insult , The staff we encountered were absolutely delightful and very helpful The rooms were clean stylish and comfortable The hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the centre of Amsterdam ,9.2, Leisure trip,2,4,4
186,2,11/29/2015,200, the building work created a bad first impression of the hotel as had to enter through a back door through building mess would expect to be notified seating in room uncomfortable as had no back rest had to sit on floor with back against settee stairs steep to go to bathroom at night was a little precarious breakfast expensive in comparison to outside restaurants , staff helpful but maybe because of building upheaval hotel history and architecture a real treat would stay again try another room and see the hotel when fully refurbished possibly have a discount due to the visit being in middle of a bulding site and not as expected when booked ,8.8, Leisure trip,2,4,4
187,2,11/14/2015,200, Room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived We found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned In addition the daily cleaning was very basic Unacceptable for an hotel of this category Such a pity because everything else was great My advice to the management is more attention to details Having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board Not conductive to maintain grow the business Listen to your customers please , Very beautiful building cozy room cool bar ,6.7, Leisure trip,4,4,3
188,2,10/30/2015,200, Would have been courteous to have been told that building work was going on Bar staff wearing jeans and trainers is not in keeping with 4 hotel Having to ask every day for milk for tea making in room Having to ask for towels that were not left in the room Room 304 no shelf in the shower for putting shampoo razor etc , Character of the hotel was great Location was good,6.3, Leisure trip,2,4,4

190,2,10/25/2015,200, Not given the room type we had booked and prepaid for No on site car park available despite pre booking of this Hotel was a building site so not very welcoming No privacy at all in bathroom as separated from lounge area by glass panel only Stairs to bed level steep and dangerous as no hand rail Arrived for our prepaid breakfast to be told we hadn t paid and had to show our payment receipt to prove we had ,No Positive,4.6, Leisure trip,2,4,3

928,5,8/25/2015,14, A room with a broken and leaking shower should not be given to guests Neither the reservation system nor the receptionists do understand that a female guest s family name can consist of two parts like maiden name plus husband s name while the respective husband has just one name This lead to the problem that an important parcel has not been accepted for which my husband was eagerly waiting Instead it was sent back by the receptionist , We had the benefit of being upgraded because of a broken shower in the room originally booked Excellent indian restaurant very friendly and normally helpful staff good continental breakfast for a good price Large number of staff Lot of storage room due to clever use of space ,8.8, Leisure trip,2,4,3

945,5,6/15/2016,36, The breakfast buffet was ample but not high quality products I would suggest going elsewhere for a good English breakfast , I was actually moved to the Paddington Court location a block away from the London Paddington still Park Grand chain I appreciated a modern comfortable well designed room that met all my needs even though it was tiny that s just London Short walk to either Paddington or Lancaster Gate stations in a very nice neighbourhood away from the tacky side of Paddington I would definitely return here in the future ,9.2, Business trip,1,4,2
946,5,5/31/2016,36, The people behind the desk really ought to be able to read the details of a booking properly to avoid guests being misdirected to a considerably smaller room This took too much time to correct , When my daughter and her friend finally were given the correct room the one that I had reserved and paid for that was a relief ,6.7, Leisure trip,2,4,2
947,5,5/18/2016,36, Room was a bit tired the air unit or heater or whatever buzzed all night which was very annoying and storage closet space was limited London itself has become a tarpit foul air congestion and everything and I mean everything is so grossly overpriced The city probably tainted my view on the hotel somewhat but I will never visit London again other than perhaps in transit to somewhere more pleasant , The area was quiet safe and easy to get to from Paddington Station Beds were comfortable ,7.5, Leisure trip,2,4,2

949,5,11/01/2015,36, The room was small and gloomy with dark panelling and inconvenient lighting It looked out into a tiny well and was badly overlooked by another room so I had to keep the curtains closed more gloom I assume I was given the room because I was travelling alone but I booked for 2 people and I was paying the same as 2 people I don t appreciate being treated as a 2nd class citizen , I liked the location the star were efficient but not particularly friendly and lacked the personal approach except the barman ,6.7, Leisure trip,1,3,2
950,5,09/09/2015,36, I booked a double deluxe room here online but when I got there they gave me a small room the size of a closet because it was available first even though I had paid the price point for a double deluxe room 450 pounds a night They then transferred me to a slightly bigger room that still wasn t a double deluxe and looked nothing like in the pictures Staff were rude and reluctant to help whenever spoken to and at one point in the lounge area we witnessed one of the staff giving a young hotel guest a loud and stern lecture about payment the whole exchange was very uncomfortable and unprofessional For 450 pounds night 800 Canadian dollars we would have gotten a spacious room in other countries with wonderful service but here I felt like I had thrown a bunch of money down the drain , The place was nicely furnished in a compact way ,5.4, Leisure trip,2,4,2

957,5,6/20/2017,50, The room was a bit small but still very good for London standards I was at first disappointed that there was no proper shower it was the floor of the toilet bathroom which you don t expect from such a hotel but in the end it was ok and the water had good pressure , A nice hotel in a very convenient location Very clean People at reception and generally everyone I interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference I also appreciated the welcome plate of fruits as well as the handy phone that comes with the room Very convenient especially when your own phone is behaving weird in other countries All this made up for the price which I initally thought a bit too much and I still booked an offer that was supposed to be largely discounted 120 a night for a compact room If I paid the full amount I would think it is overpriced but I guess that s London in the summer ,8.3, Business trip,1,4,2
958,5,4/19/2017,50, Small stuffy room and uncomfortable bed The room kettle was out of order Footpath was being resurfaced outside our window ground level Room rate was quite expensive , Convenient location Friendly staff We were transferred to another room and offered complimentary breakfast due to some problems with hot water in the room we originally booked ,6.3, Leisure trip,2,4,3
